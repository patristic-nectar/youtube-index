St. Nikolai- the New Serbian Chrysostom &ndash; has won the hearts of the entire Orthodox Christian world. This godly bishop was not only a great shepherd of his much-suffering Serbian people, but a Spirit-illumined theologian who spoke the word of truth into the very heart of the darkness of the 20 th century. Earning doctorates in his youth in both Berne, Switzerland and Oxford, England, he went on to live through World War I and World War II, traveling throughout Europe and America lifting up his voice and prayer, and setting forth the truth in Christ for the falling West in more than 30 books and innumerable sermons and lectures in innumerable venues in churches, universities, and parliaments before falling asleep in the Lord at St. Tikhon Seminary here in America in 1956. Lecture titles are as follows: Lecture #1 An Overview of the Life of St. Nikolai Lecture #2 The Prologue from Ochrid and 100 Meditations on Love Lecture #3 The Missionary Letters Lecture #4 War Lecture #5 The Life of St. Sava and his Nationalism Lecture #6 Ecumenism: Good and Bad Lecture #7 The Orthodox Catechism Lecture #8 Prayers by the Lake Lecture #9 The Miracle of the Incarnation of Jesus Christ",

He is revered for his zealous and forthright preaching and has exercised a wide influence over the Orthodox Church in the United States and abroad through his seminary teaching and innumerable parish retreats, his lectures on Ancient Faith Radio, and his many books and publications. These lectures were delivered in February of 2001 to the clergy of the Western Region (eventually the Diocese of Los Angeles and the West) of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America. In these lectures, Father Hopko opens to all the dogmatic teachings of the Orthodox Church on One God, His Only-Begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit. Here Fr. Thomas shares how Christian life is a sharing in the Divine Life itself, and much more. This March 18th, 2024 will be the 9th anniversary of Father Hopko's repose. May his memory be eternal.",

    "description": "PNP is pleased to present a new six-lecture series by Father Josiah Trenham entitled Demonology: Understanding and Winning the Spiritual Battle. The study of the Church&rsquo;s demonology is a part of basic catechism and Christian instruction. The Scriptures are replete with teaching on the dark powers. Additionally, it is impossible to appreciate the magnitude of the saving deeds of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, without understanding how He, and He alone, has conquered Satan and destroyed his works. Lastly, Christians are called to fight and win in the spiritual war, and for this reason, it is essential that believers understand their enemies and their tactics. Toward this end, Father Josiah presents in these lectures in-depth studies of the Scriptures, Divine Services, and pedagogy of great saints and teachers on the subject of Satan and spiritual battle. Lecture titles include: Lecture #1 Jesus and Satan Lecture #2 Demonology in the Baptismal Rite and the Divine Liturgy Lecture #3 Gaining Mastery of Satan: The Life of St. Anthony the Great Lecture #4 How to Win the Spiritual Battle according to St. John of the Ladder Lecture #5 Engaging the Unseen Warfare: Fr.

    "description": "Patristic Nectar Publications is pleased to present a new 5-part lecture series entitled Yielded to God: The Life and Teaching of St. Seraphim of Sarov. The significance of the life of St. Seraphim upon contemporary Orthodox Christianity is so great that it is difficult to fully grasp. Though he was a humble Russian monk born in 1759 his influence has spread to become central and definitive in all the world-wide Orthodox Church. The life of the saints is a tapestry of a life wholly crucified to self and fully yielded to the will of God. His teaching on the purpose of Christian life as the acquisition of the Holy Spirit, and his great intimacy with the Most Pure Mother of God have captured the hearts of God-lovers and provided inspiration for spiritual acquisition for almost two centuries. Lecture #1 Yielded to God: An Overview of the Life of St. Seraphim Lecture #2 Acquiring the Holy Spirit: The Purpose of the Christian Life Lecture #3 St. Seraphim and the Mother of God Lecture #4 Marriage, Monasticism, and the Saint’s Diveyevo Nuns Lecture #5 Spiritual Counsels",

This series consists of two parts. The first consists of four thematic lectures given in 2022 by Fr. Josiah to the St. John Chrysostom Catechetical School in Riverside, Ca. The second part of this series is five talks given by His Grace, Bishop Basil of Wichita, at a men’s retreat in Kansas in 2008. St. John of Kronstadt, the Wonder-Worker, served God in Russia during the second half of the 19 th century and fell asleep in Christ in 1908. His life, miracles, and teaching have been cherished by believers as God’s love gift to the Church and to the world on the cusp of the 20 th century, the most violent century in the history of humanity. These lectures and discussions reveal the beauty of a life lived supremely in and for Jesus Christ the Lord.",

One of the most shocking realities of the preaching and teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ to His early 1 st century Judean audience was His fervent, expansive, and repetitive teaching on heaven. Heaven literally permeates the Sermon on the Mount and our Savior’s Parabolic instruction. The Holy Apostles received this single-eyed focus upon the next life from the Lord Christ and passed this teaching on to their disciples in the early Church. Sacred tradition has vivified and animated the discipleship of Christians in their race toward heaven ever since. In these lectures, Father Josiah opens the Scriptures and the writings of the Church Fathers on the subject of heaven in an effort to plant a deep impression of the future life of God’s children, and to stir up a great desire for obtaining it.

The highly-esteemed hieromonk-scholar Father Calinic sets forth the majestic and high-Christology of the early Church. In these lectures, Father Cal refutes the secular criticisms of Orthodox Christology and reveals that Jesus Himself taught His Divine Identity to His disciples, that the early church both honored and preached this high Christology, and that this Christology is codified in the pages of the New Testament and the Nicene Creed. Along the way, he also reveals the secular quest of the historical Jesus to be completely vacuous, unpacks the historical theological witness about Jesus in the Pre-Nicene Church, through Nicea, Ephesus, and to the Fourth Ecumenical Council at Chalcedon. Here is a feast of faith for Christians sure to illumine our hearts and minds concerning the deity of our Lord, God, and Savior Jesus Christ.

    "description": "PNP is pleased to present a new ten-part lecture series entitled Theological Foundations: God, Man and the World in Genesis 1-3. The opening chapters of the Holy Bible provide the fundamental elements of the Christian worldview. There we learn about the One True God, the human being fashioned in God's image, and God's meaning-infused creation. These texts, which have always formed a central element in the Church's catechetical ministry, present the most important of Christian convictions. These chapters are particularly relevant today as secularism has suppressed these essential truths from the western mind, and priests can no longer assume that these basic theological affirmations are believed by those coming to the Church or raised in the Church. These lectures are presented as an aid in the formation of catechumens and as an effort to set forth the transcendent beauty of the glory of God, of the human being, and of God's magnificent world. Lecture titles are: Lecture # 1 The One True God Lecture # 2 The Tri-Personal God and His Energy Lecture # 3 The Loving Providence of God Lecture # 4 Mankind in the Image of God Lecture # 5 Pristine Man Lecture # 6 Devastated Man Lecture # 7 The World Lecture # 8 Work, Rest, Marriage, and the Sanctity of Life Lecture # 9 Satan Lecture # 10 Holy Angels",

These lectures explain why Christians cannot reasonably avoid studying transgender ideology in today’s cultural climate, how this new world-view on sexuality finds itself deficient in explaining and healing our fallen human condition, and how love must compel believers to open their arms to persons seeking God from a transgender background.

St. Peter reminds believers of their true identity in Christ, the certainty of their glorious future inheritance, the glory of suffering for the sake of Jesus Christ our Lord, and the need to defend the faith against heresy and the outbreak of immorality. Note: Please forgive a brief change in quality in a portion of the live recording of Lecture 7.",

St. Jude issues a stentorian call for Christians to go deep, to maturely appropriate their own faith, and to fight for its integrity in their own lives and in the lives of their own parishes. Jude aggressively unmasks the satanic character of the false teachers of his time who abused the grace of God and promoted licentiousness.

These two great saints of the Church, who lived in Gaza of Palestine in the sixth century, were highly-esteemed hermits who lived in relative isolation from the world, but conducted extensive correspondence with people from all walks of life and levels of society: laymen, soldiers, priests, monks, bishops and others. Their letters are remarkable for the view they give us into the process of spiritual guidance, since these letters preserve not just a question and an answer, but a series of letters recording an ongoing conversation. Though many of these letters were written to monks, they contain teachings and principles of spiritual life that are relevant to everyone who seeks to know and love God.",

Maximos searchingly penetrates into the spiritual lives of these saints by placing special emphasis upon their common experience of dereliction, or the loss of grace.

Today Christian marriage is under terrible assault. The marriage culture in America is in serious decline, and many believers have little idea of what constitutes a &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; marriage. In this series, Fr. Josiah describes the nature of the Divine-Human marriage between God and His people, between Christ and the Church, as well as the contours of authentic marriage between believers in the Church. He also describes the sad decimation of marriage progressively taking place in our post-Christian and secular culture.",

Here St. Paul unveils the orientation of his entire life when he says, \"For me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain.\" Of all St. Paul's letters in the New Testament, Philippians is the most personal. The Great Apostle had a very dear relationship with this local church, and the theme of Christian joy radiates in each of the four chapters. This is deeply intriguing since St. Paul wrote this joyful letter of thanksgiving while he was in prison! Each of the chapters contains some of the most sublime teachings of the Gospel, including in chapter 2 the most detailed Apostolic teaching on the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ found in the entire New Testament. These lectures are presented with the sincere hope that a more thorough study of this Pauline letter will fill believers with the joy which St. Paul models and of which he speaks.",

Father Josiah surveys all 42 chapters of this beloved staple of the Old Testament Wisdom literature. Orthodox Christians read the Book of Job each year during Holy Week as they prepare to experience the Saving Passion of Jesus Christ the Lord. The Much-Suffering Prophet Job is a supreme example of the \"innocent sufferer\" whose intercessions healed men and whose patient endurance of inexplicable suffering was resolved by the unfolding of God's marvelous providence.",

    "description": "Fr. Josiah exposits the Book of Revelation verse by verse in order to give the reader insight into both the original meaning of the text to its 1st century audience and a practical application of its message to the Church today. The Revelation of the Holy Apostle and Evangelist John the Theologian completes the New Testament Canon. It is both an end and a beginning, as it unveils to the Church both the cataclysmic conclusion of this falling age, and the ushering in of the New Heavens and New Earth where righteousness dwells forever. The Revelation, or the Apocalypse, as it is traditionally known, is a unique genre of literature among the 27 books of the New Testament known as \"apocalyptic.\" In 22 sacred chapters St. John reveals the zeal of the Risen Lord Jesus Christ to maintain the purity of His Church, and to lead Her victoriously into His eternal Kingdom. Under numerous symbols and images, as well as dramatic and confrontational historical depictions, the nature of the war in heaven and on earth is revealed between the Church of Jesus Christ and Her enemies: the dragon, the beast, the false prophet, the harlot and those in alliance with evil. The message of the Lord to His much-suffering Church of the 1st century and today is this: Be faithful to the end, for the Lord is coming quickly to reward those who hold fast to His Name.",

Christians are indebted to no one in the Old Testament more than to the Holy Prophet and King, David. He alone, amongst all the believers in the ancient covenant, is described by the Lord as having a &ldquo;heart for God.&rdquo; David&rsquo;s sin, in infamy 2nd only to that of Adam, has been meditated upon by believers, as has David&rsquo;s deep repentance - which has provided an image for countless penitents to imitate over the centuries in order to find peace with God. In this series, the entire life of King David from his early rise as a humble shepherd, to his years in hiding from Saul, to the magnificent covenant that God cut with him which provided the prism through which believers have come to understand He Who is the ultimate Son of David, the true King of Kings who reigns on David&rsquo;s throne at the right hand of the Father; the one&rsquo;s whose heart is gentle and perfect: Jesus Christ the Lord.",

The Desert Fathers hold a foundational place in the Church's understanding of the authentic Christian life. The Desert Fathers and Mothers are the world's \"true evangelicals\"...those whose lives were completely formed by the good news of salvation in Jesus Christ. The contours of their lives demonstrate the freedom that Jesus Christ gives to His followers who take Him at His word and submit all to His cause. In the recesses of the Egyptian desert these saints possessed life, and that abundantly. From the Gospel explosion, which was St. Antony's life written by St. Athanasios the Great, through several hundred years of Saints populating the deserts of Egypt, Syria, Palestine, and even Persia, Gaul, Britain and Ireland the Desert Fathers have provided a touchstone by which all future generations are able to measure Christian virtue.

    "description": "Digital Audio - A broad introduction to Orthodox Christianity designed to expose the catechumen to the contours of Orthodox faith and life, aid priests in preparing catechumens to be received into the Church as well as edify Orthodox individuals seeking a better understanding of their faith. For those seeking to become Orthodox, Catechism is a process of full-orbed Christian formation in which the Orthodox Christian life is inculcated in the learner through participation in divine services, prayer, study, community assimilation, and practice. At the heart of the catechetical process are the catechetical lectures delivered to the catechumens by the priest or the catechist. It is toward this goal of providing a usable introduction to Holy Orthodoxy that the sixteen lectures entitled An Orthodox Catechism have been developed by Father Josiah. This series has been utilized by Father Josiah in parish practice over the course of almost two decades to prepare more than 400 catechumens for reception into the Orthodox Church. Not having an official Orthodox Catechism in the English language, many parishes and pastors scramble to put together a basic catechism that will adequately expose the inquirer and catechumen to the contours of Orthodox faith and life. It is hoped that this series will aid priests and parishes in preparing catechumens to be received into the Church, as well as edify Orthodox individuals seeking a better understanding of their faith. These sixteen lectures are presented to catechumens in two parts. Part One: God, Man, Church is traditionally delivered over the eight weeks leading to the Feast of the Nativity of Christ. Part Two: The Holy Mysteries is delivered over the eight weeks leading up to Pasha, when catechumens are being prepared for reception into the Church on Great and Holy Saturday.",

    "description": "An examination of the major heresies of the first four centuries of Christian history, explaining the mind of the Church about the errors of each heresy, commenting upon how each heresy survives in some form today, and articulating the true faith in contrast. As the Christian faith is the greatest good on the earth, so heresy is the greatest evil in the world leading to the everlasting ruin of human persons. As the Christian faith enlightens mankind through the preaching of the Gospel, the true faith at the same time exposes error and heresy, castigating it as such in order to protect the faithful from harm and recalling those who have sadly embraced the doctrines of demons.",
