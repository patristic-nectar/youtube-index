He is married to Cristina and they are the parents of Irina (21), Andrei (10), and Miruna (6). After studying at the Faculty of Orthodox Theology in Bucharest (1994-1999), Fr Bogdan left for the USA, where he earned his MA (2002) and PhD (2007) in Religious Studies at Marquette University under the direction of (now Archbishop) Alexander Golitzin. Between 2007 and 2020, he was Assistant and then Associate Professor of Theology at Duquesne University, in Pittsburgh, where he worked in the areas of Early Christian Studies and Reception History of the Bible. In 2010 he was ordained a priest in the Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese and served as the pastor of St Anthony Orthodox Church in Butler, PA (2010-2020).\n\nFr Bogdan is a scholar of early Christianity, with a special interest in the link between reception history of the Bible and doctrinal developments in early Christianity and the Byzantine tradition. He views it as important to study how early Christians articulated their religious identity by reworking doctrines, imagery, and practices inherited from the many currents of Second Temple Judaism. His academic interests were shaped significantly by participation in the interdisciplinary Seminar on the Jewish Roots of Christian Mysticism, and the \"Theophaneia School\", both led by Professor Andrei Orlov and Archbishop Dr. Alexander Golitzin at Marquette University.\n\n———SOCIAL MEDIA———\n\nPatristic Nectar Instagram: https://bit.ly/3kmupqE\nPatristic Nectar Facebook: https://bit.ly/33Bzmpx\n\n———SUPPORT PATRISTIC NECTAR———\n\nhttps://patristicnectar.org/donations",

The Scriptures are replete with teaching on the dark powers. Additionally, it is impossible to appreciate the magnitude of the saving deeds of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, without understanding how He, and He alone, has conquered Satan and destroyed his works. Lastly, Christians are called to fight and win in the spiritual war, and for this reason, it is essential that believers understand their enemies and their tactics. Toward this end, Father Josiah presents in these lectures in-depth studies of the Scriptures, Divine Services, and pedagogy of great saints and teachers on the subject of Satan and spiritual battle. \n\nLecture titles include: \n\nLecture #1 Jesus and Satan \n\nLecture #2 Demonology in the Baptismal Rite and the Divine Liturgy \n\nLecture #3 Gaining Mastery of Satan: The Life of St. Anthony the Great \n\nLecture #4 How to Win the Spiritual Battle according to St. John of the Ladder \n\nLecture #5 Engaging the Unseen Warfare: Fr.

This series consists of two parts. The first consists of four thematic lectures given in 2022 by Fr. Josiah to the St. John Chrysostom Catechetical School in Riverside, Ca. The second part of this series is five talks given by His Grace, Bishop Basil of Wichita, at a men’s retreat in Kansas in 2008. St. John of Kronstadt, the Wonder-Worker, served God in Russia during the second half of the 19th century and fell asleep in Christ in 1908. His life, miracles, and teaching have been cherished by believers as God’s love gift to the Church and to the world on the cusp of the 20th century, the most violent century in the history of humanity.  These lectures and discussions reveal the beauty of a life lived supremely in and for Jesus Christ the Lord.\n\nLecture #1 - The Life of Saint John of Kronstadt\n\nLecture #2 - On Prayer\n\nLecture #3 - The Eucharist and Divine Liturgy\n\nLecture #4 - On the Priesthood\n\nLecture #5 - The Russia of St. John of Kronstadt\n\nLecture #6 - Confession and Communion in St. John's Teaching\n\nLecture #7 - Q&A (Part 1)\n\nLecture #8 - St. John Counsels and Teachings on Prayer\n\nLecture #9 - Q&A (Part 2)\n\n\n———SOCIAL MEDIA———\n\nPatristic Nectar Instagram: https://bit.ly/3kmupqE\nPatristic Nectar Facebook: https://bit.ly/33Bzmpx\nPatristic Nectar Twitter: https://bit.ly/3igrH4f\n\n\n———SUPPORT PATRISTIC NECTAR———\n\n1) Spread the Word - tell your family and friends about Patristic Nectar.

One of the most shocking realities of the preaching and teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ to His early 1st century Judean audience was His fervent, expansive, and repetitive teaching on heaven. Heaven literally permeates the Sermon on the Mount and our Savior’s Parabolic instruction. The Holy Apostles received this single-eyed focus upon the next life from the Lord Christ and passed this teaching on to their disciples in the early Church. Sacred tradition has vivified and animated the discipleship of Christians in their race toward heaven ever since. In these lectures, Father Josiah opens the Scriptures and the writings of the Church Fathers on the subject of heaven in an effort to plant a deep impression of the future life of God’s children, and to stir up a great desire for obtaining it.\n\nLecture titles are:                                                 \n\nLecture #1 Heaven in the Holy Gospels\n\nLecture #2 Heaven in the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles\n\nLecture #3 Heaven in the Apocalypse\n\nLecture #4 Heaven in the Church Fathers: A Florilegium\n\nLecture #5 Heaven: A Definitive End and a New Beginning\n\nLecture #6 What is Heaven Actually Like: Common Questions\n\nLecture #7 Heaven Mislaid: The Eclipse of Heaven in the Secular West and the Christian Response\n\n\n———SOCIAL MEDIA———\n\nPatristic Nectar Instagram: https://bit.ly/3kmupqE\nPatristic Nectar Facebook: https://bit.ly/33Bzmpx\nPatristic Nectar Twitter: https://bit.ly/3igrH4f\n\n\n———SUPPORT PATRISTIC NECTAR———\n\n1) Spread the Word - tell your family and friends about Patristic Nectar.

    "description": "Father Josiah Trenham\n\nTo Access Global Catechism: \nhttps://patristicnectar.org/globalcatechism\n\nOur Newest Lecture Series:\nDemonology: Understanding & Winning the Spiritual Battle\n\nClick Here: https://patristicnectar.org/bookstore_220620_11222221112\n\nThe study of the Church’s demonology is a part of basic catechism and Christian instruction. The Scriptures are replete with teaching on the dark powers. Additionally, it is impossible to appreciate the magnitude of the saving deeds of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, without understanding how He, and He alone, has conquered Satan and destroyed his works. Lastly, Christians are called to fight and win in the spiritual war, and for this reason, it is essential that believers understand their enemies and their tactics. Toward this end, Father Josiah presents in these lectures in-depth studies of the Scriptures, Divine Services, and pedagogy of great saints and teachers on the subject of Satan and spiritual battle. \n\nLecture titles include: \n\nLecture #1 Jesus and Satan \n\nLecture #2 Demonology in the Baptismal Rite and the Divine Liturgy \n\nLecture #3 Gaining Mastery of Satan: The Life of St. Anthony the Great \n\nLecture #4 How to Win the Spiritual Battle according to St. John of the Ladder \n\nLecture #5 Engaging the Unseen Warfare: Fr. Lorenzo Scupoli and St. Nicodemos of the Holy Mountain \n\nLecture #6 C. S. Lewis’ Screwtape Letters and Demonic Warfare in the 21st Century Falling West \n\nIf you are interested in other available titles, or if you would like more information on Patristic Nectar Publications, please visit our website at www.PatristicNectar.org\n\n———SOCIAL MEDIA———\n\nPatristic Nectar Instagram: https://bit.ly/3kmupqE\nPatristic Nectar Facebook: https://bit.ly/33Bzmpx\nPatristic Nectar Twitter: https://bit.ly/3igrH4f\n\n\n———SUPPORT PATRISTIC NECTAR———\n\n1) Spread the Word - tell your family and friends about Patristic Nectar.

    "description": "In this reflection, Father Josiah Trenham responds to a recent Supreme Court ruling involving a Catholic charter school in Oklahoma. He uses the case to highlight deeper concerns about the lack of school choice, the forced public funding of anti-Christian education, and the overall decline of moral and academic standards in the U.S. education system. Why are families restricted from directing their tax dollars to schools that reflect their values? What are the long-term effects of an aggressively secular public school system?\nIs there hope for restoring freedom and faith in American education?\n\nFather Josiah calls for renewed moral clarity, Christian engagement, and educational liberty in a time of deep cultural confusion.\n\n📲 Access More Orthodox Content:\n\nPatristic Nectar App:\n\nApp Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/patristic-nectar/id6502949324\n\nGoogle Play: https://play.google.com/store/search?q=patristic+nectar+app&c=apps\n\nSpotify Podcast: https://open.spotify.com/show/1VKxdB2ZCzk8evUA4V7tku?si=b679feac4ab34d63\n\nNew Book – Enduring Love: Laying Christian Foundations for Marriage\n\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/Enduring-Love-Christian-Foundations-Marriage/dp/1735011657\n\nBarnes & Noble: https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/enduring-love-josiah-trenham/1144547044?ean=9781735011653\n\n🙏 Support Our Ministry:\n\nMake a Donation:\n*Text “PNP” to 53555 to make a tax-deductible donation.*\n\nMerchandise: https://patristic-nectar.mybigcommerce.com\n\nPray for Us\n\n🔔 Subscribe & Share:\nHelp spread the wisdom of the Church Fathers by liking, sharing, and subscribing!\n\n#OrthodoxChristianity #ChurchFathers #ChristianFaith #SpiritualGrowth #FaithAndWorks #Theology #EasternOrthodoxy #Catechesis #ChristianTradition #GospelTruth #ChristianDoctrine #OrthodoxTeaching #DivineWisdom #ChristianLiving #NoOtherGods #FatherJosiahTrenham #PatristicNectar #feminism #neuralink",

The Scriptures are replete with teaching on the dark powers. Additionally, it is impossible to appreciate the magnitude of the saving deeds of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, without understanding how He, and He alone, has conquered Satan and destroyed his works. Lastly, Christians are called to fight and win in the spiritual war, and for this reason, it is essential that believers understand their enemies and their tactics. Toward this end, Father Josiah presents in these lectures in-depth studies of the Scriptures, Divine Services, and pedagogy of great saints and teachers on the subject of Satan and spiritual battle. \n\nLecture titles include: \n\nLecture #1 Jesus and Satan \n\nLecture #2 Demonology in the Baptismal Rite and the Divine Liturgy \n\nLecture #3 Gaining Mastery of Satan: The Life of St. Anthony the Great \n\nLecture #4 How to Win the Spiritual Battle according to St. John of the Ladder \n\nLecture #5 Engaging the Unseen Warfare: Fr. Lorenzo Scupoli and St. Nicodemos of the Holy Mountain \n\nLecture #6 C. S.

St. Maximos Confessor lived and taught in the 7th century, and his contribution to the promotion of Holy Orthodoxy is virtually unmatched. Fr. Maximos, the premier Maximos scholar in the contemporary Orthodox world, has recently completed the first-ever complete English translation of St. Maximos' Ambigua. The Ambigua, an effort by St. Maximos to interpret some 70 difficult passages in the writing of St. Gregory the Theologian, is perhaps the most difficult patristic text to translate and interpret. The Ambigua is published by Harvard University Press, and is available for less than $30 a volume.",

    "title": "An Impatient Patience: Achieving Orthodox Unity and Canonical Normalization in the West",
    "description": "Four years ago, in June of 2009, something momentous took place in World Orthodoxy. At the invitation of His All Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, delegates from the fourteen Autocephalous Orthodox Churches participated in the historic Fourth Pre-Conciliar Pan-Orthodox Conference, meeting at the Center of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Chambésy-Geneva, Switzerland. They expressed their \"desire for the swift healing of every canonical anomaly that has arisen from historical circumstances and pastoral requirements, such as in the so-called Orthodox Diaspora, with a view to overcoming every possible influence that is foreign to Orthodox ecclesiology.\"\n\nThis ecumenical decision translated quickly into the establishment of Episcopal Assemblies of Orthodox Bishops in 12 locations throughout the world in historically non-Orthodox lands. Here in America the Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops is set to convene for its fourth annual meeting in just a week or so in Chicago, Sept. 17th-19th, 2013.\n\nWhat exactly are the bishops doing? What is being accomplished? And what is the purpose and intent of these Assemblies throughout the West?\n\nIn this extensive 30-minute interview produced by Patristic Nectar Films the internationally acclaimed Orthodox theologian Metropolitan Kallistos (Ware) addresses just these questions to provide a context to understand the movement of the Holy Spirit in these assemblies today.\n\nTo learn more about Metropolitan Kallistos (Ware), please visit:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kallistos_Ware\n\nPatristic Nectar Publications (PNP) is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing spiritual edification and formal Orthodox Christian catechesis.  It publishes the teachings of the Church as expressed by the Holy Fathers through a vast array of patristic audio books and lecture series, spreading the wealth of Sacred Tradition to the modern-day media culture.  PNP is distinctive in the fidelity of its publications to the mind of the Church, and the freedom in the publications from personal opinions and theological fads.\n\nNourishing the spiritually thirsty with the sweet teachings of the Holy Fathers.",

    "description": "In this special two part series, Kevin Allen (Host of Ancient Faith Today) sits down with Father Josiah Trenham, author of the new book Rock and Sand; An Orthodox Appraisal of the Protestant Reformation and Their Teachings.\n\nThis book has been written for three purposes. First, to provide the Orthodox reader with a competent overview of the history of Protestantism and its major traditions, from its beginnings in the 16th century to the present day. This overview relies heavily upon the Reformer s own words as well as the creeds of various Protestant faiths, in order to avoid misrepresentation and caricature. Second, to acquaint Orthodox and non-Orthodox readers with a narrative of the historical relations between the Orthodox East and the Protestant West. Finally, to provide a summary of Ortho- dox theological opinion on the tenets of Protestantism.\n\nARCHPRIEST JOSIAH TRENHAM was ordained to the Holy Priesthood in 1993, and was awarded the Ph.D. in Theology from the University of Durham, England, in 2004. \nFr. Josiah serves as an instructor in and on the Board of Advisors of the Ss. Cyril and Athanasius Orthodox Institute in San Francisco. He is an adjunct professor of theology at St. Katherine College in Encinitas, Ca. (2010-present), and was an Adjunct Professor of History at California Baptist University (2003-2010). He is a member of the Orthodox Theological Society of America, and participates in yearly academic forums and symposia. Since 2004 he has served on the Mayoral Environmental Committee (GAP) of the City of Riverside. Fr. Josiah has also served as a member of the Secretariat of the Assembly of Orthodox Bishops in the United States since its inception in May, 2010. \nFr. Josiah s books and articles have been published by St. Herman Press, Zoe Press, St. Vladimir s Orthodox Theological Journal, Logos: A Journal of Eastern Christian Studies, The Journal of the Institute on Religion and Democracy, CIVA: The Journal of Christians in the Visual Arts, Divine Ascent, The Word Magazine, OrthodoxyToday.org, American Orthodox Institute, Sourozh, Pemptousia.com (Vatopaidi Monastery), Eastern Churches Review, and elsewhere.\n\nTo purchase Rock and Sand you can  visit http://store.ancientfaith.com/rock-and-sand/\n\nListen to the audiobook version of Rock and Sand (read by the author Fr.

Though he was a humble Russian monk born in 1759 his influence has spread to become central and definitive in all the world-wide Orthodox Church. The life of the saints is a tapestry of a life wholly crucified to self and fully yielded to the will of God. His teaching on the purpose of Christian life as the acquisition of the Holy Spirit, and his great intimacy with the Most Pure Mother of God have captured the hearts of God-lovers and provided inspiration for spiritual acquisition for almost two centuries.\n\nLecture 1 Yielded to God: An Overview of the Life of St. Seraphim\nLecture 2 Acquiring the Holy Spirit: The Purpose of the Christian Life\nLecture 3 St. Seraphim and the Mother of GodLecture #4 Marriage, Monasticism, and the Saint’s Diveyevo Nuns\nLecture 5 Spiritual Counsels\n\nDownload our Digital Catalogue here:\nhttps://www.patristicnectar.org/digitalcatalogue\n\nIf you are interested in other available titles, or if you would like more information on Patristic Nectar Publications, please visit our website at www.PatristicNectar.org\n\n\n———SOCIAL MEDIA———\n\nPatristic Nectar Instagram: https://bit.ly/3kmupqE\nPatristic Nectar Facebook: https://bit.ly/33Bzmpx\nPatristic Nectar Twitter: https://bit.ly/3igrH4f\n\n\n———SUPPORT PATRISTIC NECTAR———\n\n1) Spread the Word - tell your family and friends about Patristic Nectar.

One of the most shocking realities of the preaching and teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ to His early 1st century Judean audience was His fervent, expansive, and repetitive teaching on heaven. Heaven literally permeates the Sermon on the Mount and our Savior’s Parabolic instruction. The Holy Apostles received this single-eyed focus upon the next life from the Lord Christ and passed this teaching on to their disciples in the early Church. Sacred tradition has vivified and animated the discipleship of Christians in their race toward heaven ever since. In these lectures, Father Josiah opens the Scriptures and the writings of the Church Fathers on the subject of heaven in an effort to plant a deep impression of the future life of God’s children, and to stir up a great desire for obtaining it.\n\nLecture titles are:                                                 \n\nLecture #1 Heaven in the Holy Gospels\n\nLecture #2 Heaven in the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles\n\nLecture #3 Heaven in the Apocalypse\n\nLecture #4 Heaven in the Church Fathers: A Florilegium\n\nLecture #5 Heaven: A Definitive End and a New Beginning\n\nLecture #6 What is Heaven Actually Like: Common Questions\n\nLecture #7 Heaven Mislaid: The Eclipse of Heaven in the Secular West and the Christian Response\n\n\n———SOCIAL MEDIA———\n\nPatristic Nectar Instagram: https://bit.ly/3kmupqE\nPatristic Nectar Facebook: https://bit.ly/33Bzmpx\nPatristic Nectar Twitter: https://bit.ly/3igrH4f\n\n\n———SUPPORT PATRISTIC NECTAR———\n\n1) Spread the Word - tell your family and friends about Patristic Nectar.

This series consists of two parts. The first consists of four thematic lectures given in 2022 by Fr. Josiah to the St. John Chrysostom Catechetical School in Riverside, Ca. The second part of this series is five talks given by His Grace, Bishop Basil of Wichita, at a men’s retreat in Kansas in 2008. St. John of Kronstadt, the Wonder-Worker, served God in Russia during the second half of the 19th century and fell asleep in Christ in 1908. His life, miracles, and teaching have been cherished by believers as God’s love gift to the Church and to the world on the cusp of the 20th century, the most violent century in the history of humanity.

One of the most shocking realities of the preaching and teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ to His early 1st century Judean audience was His fervent, expansive, and repetitive teaching on heaven. Heaven literally permeates the Sermon on the Mount and our Savior’s Parabolic instruction. The Holy Apostles received this single-eyed focus upon the next life from the Lord Christ and passed this teaching on to their disciples in the early Church. Sacred tradition has vivified and animated the discipleship of Christians in their race toward heaven ever since. In these lectures, Father Josiah opens the Scriptures and the writings of the Church Fathers on the subject of heaven in an effort to plant a deep impression of the future life of God’s children, and to stir up a great desire for obtaining it.\n\nLecture titles are:                                                 \n\nLecture #1 Heaven in the Holy Gospels\n\nLecture #2 Heaven in the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles\n\nLecture #3 Heaven in the Apocalypse\n\nLecture #4 Heaven in the Church Fathers: A Florilegium\n\nLecture #5 Heaven: A Definitive End and a New Beginning\n\nLecture #6 What is Heaven Actually Like: Common Questions\n\nLecture #7 Heaven Mislaid: The Eclipse of Heaven in the Secular West and the Christian Response\n\n\n———SOCIAL MEDIA———\n\nPatristic Nectar Instagram: https://bit.ly/3kmupqE\nPatristic Nectar Facebook: https://bit.ly/33Bzmpx\nPatristic Nectar Twitter: https://bit.ly/3igrH4f\n\n\n———SUPPORT PATRISTIC NECTAR———\n\n1) Spread the Word - tell your family and friends about Patristic Nectar.

    "description": "March 17th, 2020\n\nFather Josiah Trenham\n\nPatristic Nectar Publications\n\nPrayer at the Time of the Coronavirus Pandemic  \n\nO Lord our God, look down from Thy Holy Heaven on the supplications of Thy sinful and unworthy servants, who have angered Thy graciousness by our transgressions, and have provoked Thy deep compassion, and enter not into judgment with Thy servants. But do Thou turn aside Thy fearsome anger that justly has seized us, appease the destructive threatening, avert Thy terrible sword that, although invisible, is cutting us grievously, and spare us.  O Lord of heaven and earth, and of all creation visible and invisible, be Thou our Helper and Defender in this day of affliction. Thou knowest our weakness. Thou hearest our cry in repentance and contrition of heart. O Lord who lovest mankind, deliver us from the impending threat of the Coronavirus. Send thine angel to watch over us and protect us. Grant health and recovery to those suffering from this virus.\n\nDo Thou bless the ministry of the clergy, guide the hands of physicians, nurses and caregivers, and inspire the scientists and researchers in search of a vaccine, who together are laboring to bring healing and relief to those who are suffering from this virus. Grant unto all Thy people a spirit of fortitude, a confident faith, a lively reliance upon Thy divine providence, and a sober meditation upon the fragility of life and certainty of death. Adorn us with a heart of compassion for all, and free us from the fear born of unbelief. Enable us to continue to worship Thee, our God, and to serve the suffering in peace that together we may glorify Thy most honorable and majestic Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, now and ever and unto ages of ages.",

    "description": "In this teaching, Bishop Irenei addresses the often-asked question: Does the Orthodox Church acknowledge sacraments outside her life? He explains that the Orthodox understanding of the sacraments (or mysteries) is rooted in the life of the Church as the Body of Christ. By definition, sacraments are acts of the Church, enacted by Christ through His Body, and therefore cannot exist apart from her.\n\n🎟️ Get tickets now for our Marriage Conference:\n👉 https://www.themarriageconference.com/\n\n📲 Access More Orthodox Content:\n\n*Patristic Nectar App*\n\nApp Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/patristic-nectar/id6502949324\n\nGoogle Play: https://play.google.com/store/search?q=patristic+nectar+app&c=apps\n\nSpotify Podcast: https://open.spotify.com/show/1VKxdB2ZCzk8evUA4V7tku?si=3d093e78d53948bb\n\n🙏 Support Our Ministry:\n\nDonate: Text PNP to 53555 (tax-deductible)\n\n*Merchandise:*  https://patristic-nectar.mybigcommerce.com\n\n#OrthodoxChristianity #ChurchFathers #ChristianFaith #SpiritualGrowth #FaithAndWorks #Theology #EasternOrthodoxy #Catechesis #ChristianTradition #GospelTruth #ChristianDoctrine #OrthodoxTeaching #DivineWisdom #ChristianLiving #FatherJosiahTrenham #PatristicNectar",

    "description": "Father Josiah Trenham + Bishop Irenei\n\nWhat does it really mean to say that humanity has a “fallen nature”? Is this just Western theological baggage — or is it deeply rooted in Orthodox tradition? In this video, we explore how the Orthodox Church understands the language of the “Fall” — not as a doctrine of total depravity, but as a profound spiritual condition described throughout the Fathers, liturgical texts, and scripture. Discover why Orthodox theology still uses terms like \"fallen man,\" and how fasting, almsgiving, and true repentance are tools for healing, not punishment.\n\n📲 Access More Orthodox Content:\n\nPatristic Nectar App:\n\nApp Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/patristic-nectar/id6502949324\n\nGoogle Play: https://play.google.com/store/search?q=patristic+nectar+app&c=apps\n\nSpotify Podcast: https://open.spotify.com/show/1VKxdB2ZCzk8evUA4V7tku?si=b679feac4ab34d63\n\nNew Book – Enduring Love: Laying Christian Foundations for Marriage\n\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/Enduring-Love-Christian-Foundations-Marriage/dp/1735011657\n\nBarnes & Noble: https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/enduring-love-josiah-trenham/1144547044?ean=9781735011653\n\n🙏 Support Our Ministry:\n\nMake a Donation:\n*Text “PNP” to 53555 to make a tax-deductible donation.*\n\nMerchandise: https://patristic-nectar.mybigcommerce.com\n\nPray for Us\n\n🔔 Subscribe & Share:\nHelp spread the wisdom of the Church Fathers by liking, sharing, and subscribing!\n\n#OrthodoxChristianity #ChurchFathers #ChristianFaith #SpiritualGrowth #FaithAndWorks #Theology #EasternOrthodoxy #Catechesis #ChristianTradition #GospelTruth #ChristianDoctrine #OrthodoxTeaching #DivineWisdom #ChristianLiving #NoOtherGods #FatherJosiahTrenham #PatristicNectar",

Though he was a humble Russian monk born in 1759 his influence has spread to become central and definitive in all the world-wide Orthodox Church. The life of the saints is a tapestry of a life wholly crucified to self and fully yielded to the will of God. His teaching on the purpose of Christian life as the acquisition of the Holy Spirit, and his great intimacy with the Most Pure Mother of God have captured the hearts of God-lovers and provided inspiration for spiritual acquisition for almost two centuries.\n\nLecture 1 Yielded to God: An Overview of the Life of St. Seraphim\nLecture 2 Acquiring the Holy Spirit: The Purpose of the Christian Life\nLecture 3 St. Seraphim and the Mother of GodLecture #4 Marriage, Monasticism, and the Saint’s Diveyevo Nuns\nLecture 5 Spiritual Counsels\n\nDownload our Digital Catalogue here:\nhttps://www.patristicnectar.org/digitalcatalogue\n\nIf you are interested in other available titles, or if you would like more information on Patristic Nectar Publications, please visit our website at www.PatristicNectar.org\n\n———LINKS———\n\nhttps://patristicnectar.org/\n\nLet Everything That Hath Breath Praise the Lord: The Psalms in the Divine Services\nhttps://patristicnectar.org/bookstore_220620_11222\n\n\n———SOCIAL MEDIA———\n\nPatristic Nectar Instagram: https://bit.ly/3kmupqE\nPatristic Nectar Facebook: https://bit.ly/33Bzmpx\nPatristic Nectar Twitter: https://bit.ly/3igrH4f\n\n\n———SUPPORT PATRISTIC NECTAR———\n\n1) Spread the Word - tell your family and friends about Patristic Nectar.

If you found this interview to be of interest, and would like a deeper dive into the topic, follow the link below and watch the seven lectures and Q&A sessions delivered at the conference. \n\nClick the link below :\nhttps://www.crowdcast.io/e/holyorthodoxy/register\n\nRegistration includes the audio lectures delivered to your Patristic Nectar account library.\n\nor purchase the audio only lectures (video lectures not included, must register with link above):\n\nhttps://patristicnectar.org/bookstore_220620_1\n\nFr Maximos is Professor of Patristics and Orthodox Spirituality. A summa cum laude graduate of Holy Cross (1987), he completed his PhD in Patristics and Historical Theology at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. (1993), after which he taught at Hellenic College and Holy Cross (1993-1998). In the fall of 1998, he was invited to join the faculty of Harvard Divinity School, where he was Professor of Patristics and Orthodox Theology from 1998-2004. Responding to a life-long calling to the monastic life, he resigned his position at Harvard and was tonsured a great-schema monk at the Holy Monastery of Simonopetra, where he lived from 2004-2011. He was subsequently invited by Archbishop Demetrios to return to Holy Cross, where he has been an outstanding teacher, rigorous academic mentor, and prolific scholar. His publications include five books, more than fifty articles (many of them of monograph-length), and a dozen translated volumes. His current research project is a first-ever critical edition and English translation of the Life of the Virgin by the tenth-century Byzantine writer John Geometres.\n\nFr. Maximos teaches courses on the theology of the Church Fathers, including St Basil the Great, St Gregory the Theologian, St Dionysius the Areopagite, St Symeon the New Theologian, and especially St Maximos the Confessor, on whom he is an internationally recognized specialist.

    "description": "This interview was conducted at the conclusion of the 2022 Annual Patristic Nectar Conference, held at Saint Andrew Orthodox Christian Church, in Riverside California. If you found this interview to be of interest, and would like a deeper dive into the topic, follow the link below and watch the seven lectures and Q&A sessions delivered at the conference. \n\nClick the link below :\nhttps://www.crowdcast.io/e/holyorthodoxy/register\n\nRegistration includes the audio lectures delivered to your Patristic Nectar account library.\n\nor purchase the audio only lectures (video lectures not included, must register with link above):\n\nhttps://patristicnectar.org/bookstore_220620_1\n\nFr Maximos is Professor of Patristics and Orthodox Spirituality. A summa cum laude graduate of Holy Cross (1987), he completed his PhD in Patristics and Historical Theology at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. (1993), after which he taught at Hellenic College and Holy Cross (1993-1998). In the fall of 1998, he was invited to join the faculty of Harvard Divinity School, where he was Professor of Patristics and Orthodox Theology from 1998-2004. Responding to a life-long calling to the monastic life, he resigned his position at Harvard and was tonsured a great-schema monk at the Holy Monastery of Simonopetra, where he lived from 2004-2011. He was subsequently invited by Archbishop Demetrios to return to Holy Cross, where he has been an outstanding teacher, rigorous academic mentor, and prolific scholar. His publications include five books, more than fifty articles (many of them of monograph-length), and a dozen translated volumes. His current research project is a first-ever critical edition and English translation of the Life of the Virgin by the tenth-century Byzantine writer John Geometres.\n\nFr. Maximos teaches courses on the theology of the Church Fathers, including St Basil the Great, St Gregory the Theologian, St Dionysius the Areopagite, St Symeon the New Theologian, and especially St Maximos the Confessor, on whom he is an internationally recognized specialist. His research interests focus on the Patristic and Byzantine interpretation of Scripture, the Philokalia and Orthodox spirituality, the study of Byzantine manuscripts, and the theological study of Byzantine art, icons, and iconography.

First, to provide the Orthodox reader with a competent overview of the history of Protestantism and its major traditions, from its beginnings in the 16th century to the present day. This overview relies heavily upon the Reformer s own words as well as the creeds of various Protestant faiths, in order to avoid misrepresentation and caricature. Second, to acquaint Orthodox and non-Orthodox readers with a narrative of the historical relations between the Orthodox East and the Protestant West. Finally, to provide a summary of Ortho- dox theological opinion on the tenets of Protestantism.\n\nARCHPRIEST JOSIAH TRENHAM was ordained to the Holy Priesthood in 1993, and was awarded the Ph.D. in Theology from the University of Durham, England, in 2004. \nFr. Josiah serves as an instructor in and on the Board of Advisors of the Ss. Cyril and Athanasius Orthodox Institute in San Francisco. He is an adjunct professor of theology at St. Katherine College in Encinitas, Ca. (2010-present), and was an Adjunct Professor of History at California Baptist University (2003-2010). He is a member of the Orthodox Theological Society of America, and participates in yearly academic forums and symposia. Since 2004 he has served on the Mayoral Environmental Committee (GAP) of the City of Riverside. Fr. Josiah has also served as a member of the Secretariat of the Assembly of Orthodox Bishops in the United States since its inception in May, 2010. \nFr. Josiah s books and articles have been published by St. Herman Press, Zoe Press, St. Vladimir s Orthodox Theological Journal, Logos: A Journal of Eastern Christian Studies, The Journal of the Institute on Religion and Democracy, CIVA: The Journal of Christians in the Visual Arts, Divine Ascent, The Word Magazine, OrthodoxyToday.org, American Orthodox Institute, Sourozh, Pemptousia.com (Vatopaidi Monastery), Eastern Churches Review, and elsewhere.\n\nListen to the audiobook version of Rock and Sand (read by the author Fr.

Well-known patristics scholar and respected arch-pastor Bishop Irenei labors in this series to help believers approach the theology of creation from the presuppositions of the Church instead of through the prisms of evolution and creationism. By an intensive examination of the foundational texts of Genesis, together with numerous sources from the Church Fathers, Bishop Irenei enables us to perceive the Church’s own theological priorities and emphases when addressing the subject of creation.\n\nLecture titles include:   \n\nLecture #1 The Lamb Slain Before the Foundation of the World: Moving Beyond Creationism and Evolution \n\nLecture #2 The Order of Salvation: The Creation of the Cosmos as the Beginning of the Church in Genesis \n\nLecture #3 The Fashioning of Man: The Pinnacle of Creation \n\nLecture #4 Creation and Its Consequences: The Sanctity of Life and Ecology \n\nLecture #5 Review with Q and A \n\n\nIf you are interested in other available titles, or if you would like more information on Patristic Nectar Publications, please visit our website at www.PatristicNectar.org\n\n\n———SOCIAL MEDIA———\n\nPatristic Nectar Instagram: https://bit.ly/3kmupqE\nPatristic Nectar Facebook: https://bit.ly/33Bzmpx\nPatristic Nectar Twitter: https://bit.ly/3igrH4f\n\n\n———SUPPORT PATRISTIC NECTAR———\n\n1) Spread the Word - tell your family and friends about Patristic Nectar.

Here in these sacred pages we discover what St. Paul calls “new creation in Christ.”\n\nHere we discover what is the birth-right of Christians – that is the continuous miracle of church life.

    "description": "What’s the real difference between John the Baptist’s baptism and the baptism of Jesus Christ? In this powerful Orthodox reflection, Fr. Josiah Trenham explains why John’s baptism—though it forgave sins—was only a partial prelude to the life-giving, Spirit-filled baptism offered by Christ. Drawing on Holy Scripture, the Church Fathers (especially St. Photius the Great), and deep Orthodox theology, Fr. Josiah shows why Christian baptism is more than water—it's fire, Spirit, renewal, and adoption into the family of God.\n\n📲 Access More Orthodox Content:\n\nPatristic Nectar App:\n\nApp Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/patristic-nectar/id6502949324\n\nGoogle Play: https://play.google.com/store/search?q=patristic+nectar+app&c=apps\n\nSpotify Podcast: https://open.spotify.com/show/1VKxdB2ZCzk8evUA4V7tku?si=b679feac4ab34d63\n\nNew Book – Enduring Love: Laying Christian Foundations for Marriage\n\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/Enduring-Love-Christian-Foundations-Marriage/dp/1735011657\n\nBarnes & Noble: https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/enduring-love-josiah-trenham/1144547044?ean=9781735011653\n\n🙏 Support Our Ministry:\n\nMake a Donation:\n*Text “PNP” to 53555 to make a tax-deductible donation.*\n\nMerchandise: https://patristic-nectar.mybigcommerce.com\n\nPray for Us\n\n🔔 Subscribe & Share:\nHelp spread the wisdom of the Church Fathers by liking, sharing, and subscribing!\n\n#OrthodoxChristianity #ChurchFathers #ChristianFaith #SpiritualGrowth #FaithAndWorks #Theology #EasternOrthodoxy #Catechesis #ChristianTradition #GospelTruth #ChristianDoctrine #OrthodoxTeaching #DivineWisdom #ChristianLiving #NoOtherGods #FatherJosiahTrenham #PatristicNectar #feminism #pride",

The Scriptures are replete with teaching on the dark powers. Additionally, it is impossible to appreciate the magnitude of the saving deeds of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, without understanding how He, and He alone, has conquered Satan and destroyed his works. Lastly, Christians are called to fight and win in the spiritual war, and for this reason, it is essential that believers understand their enemies and their tactics. Toward this end, Father Josiah presents in these lectures in-depth studies of the Scriptures, Divine Services, and pedagogy of great saints and teachers on the subject of Satan and spiritual battle. \n\nLecture titles include: \n\nLecture #1 Jesus and Satan \n\nLecture #2 Demonology in the Baptismal Rite and the Divine Liturgy \n\nLecture #3 Gaining Mastery of Satan: The Life of St. Anthony the Great \n\nLecture #4 How to Win the Spiritual Battle according to St. John of the Ladder \n\nLecture #5 Engaging the Unseen Warfare: Fr.

The Scriptures are replete with teaching on the dark powers. Additionally, it is impossible to appreciate the magnitude of the saving deeds of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, without understanding how He, and He alone, has conquered Satan and destroyed his works. Lastly, Christians are called to fight and win in the spiritual war, and for this reason, it is essential that believers understand their enemies and their tactics. Toward this end, Father Josiah presents in these lectures in-depth studies of the Scriptures, Divine Services, and pedagogy of great saints and teachers on the subject of Satan and spiritual battle. \n\nLecture titles include: \n\nLecture #1 Jesus and Satan \n\nLecture #2 Demonology in the Baptismal Rite and the Divine Liturgy \n\nLecture #3 Gaining Mastery of Satan: The Life of St. Anthony the Great \n\nLecture #4 How to Win the Spiritual Battle according to St. John of the Ladder \n\nLecture #5 Engaging the Unseen Warfare: Fr.

Well-known patristics scholar and respected arch-pastor Bishop Irenei labors in this series to help believers approach the theology of creation from the presuppositions of the Church instead of through the prisms of evolution and creationism. By an intensive examination of the foundational texts of Genesis, together with numerous sources from the Church Fathers, Bishop Irenei enables us to perceive the Church’s own theological priorities and emphases when addressing the subject of creation.\n\nLecture titles include:   \n\nLecture #1 The Lamb Slain Before the Foundation of the World: Moving Beyond Creationism and Evolution \n\nLecture #2 The Order of Salvation: The Creation of the Cosmos as the Beginning of the Church in Genesis \n\nLecture #3 The Fashioning of Man: The Pinnacle of Creation \n\nLecture #4 Creation and Its Consequences: The Sanctity of Life and Ecology \n\nLecture #5 Review with Q and A \n\n\nIf you are interested in other available titles, or if you would like more information on Patristic Nectar Publications, please visit our website at www.PatristicNectar.org\n\n\n———SOCIAL MEDIA———\n\nPatristic Nectar Instagram: https://bit.ly/3kmupqE\nPatristic Nectar Facebook: https://bit.ly/33Bzmpx\nPatristic Nectar Twitter: https://bit.ly/3igrH4f\n\n\n———SUPPORT PATRISTIC NECTAR———\n\n1) Spread the Word - tell your family and friends about Patristic Nectar.

The Wisdom of Sirach or Ecclesiasticus, as the book is known in the Western or Latin tradition, is a choice composition from the Wisdom literature of the Old Testament.  Written in the 2nd century BC in Hebrew and translated into Greek by the author's grandson in Alexandria, Egypt, this majestic portion of Holy Scripture combines the rich aphorisms of traditional Hebrew sapiential literature with the concerns and background of 2nd-century Hellenic culture. Jesus, the Son of Sirach, was highly prized by the Church Fathers from the earliest days of the Church. In these five lectures, Father Josiah hones in on the themes of learning and seeking wisdom, humility, work, wealth, almsgiving, friendship, social life, wives, women, medicine and physicians, youth and aging, and wise speech and the power of words. In these topical lectures, practical substance is given to the practice of the fear of God in a wide array of human activity so that the servant of God pleases the Lord and lives thoroughly and thoughtfully before Him.  \n\nLecture #1 - Learning and Humility.\n\nLecture #2 - Work and Wealth in Sirach\n\nLecture #3 - Almsgiving, Friendship, and Social Relations\n\nLecture #4 - Wives, Women, and the Stages of Life\n\nLecture #5 - Wise Words\n\n\n———SOCIAL MEDIA———\n\nPatristic Nectar Instagram: https://bit.ly/3kmupqE\nPatristic Nectar Facebook: https://bit.ly/33Bzmpx\nPatristic Nectar Twitter: https://bit.ly/3igrH4f\n\n\n———SUPPORT PATRISTIC NECTAR———\n\n1) Spread the Word - tell your family and friends about Patristic Nectar.

One of the most shocking realities of the preaching and teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ to His early 1st century Judean audience was His fervent, expansive, and repetitive teaching on heaven. Heaven literally permeates the Sermon on the Mount and our Savior’s Parabolic instruction. The Holy Apostles received this single-eyed focus upon the next life from the Lord Christ and passed this teaching on to their disciples in the early Church. Sacred tradition has vivified and animated the discipleship of Christians in their race toward heaven ever since. In these lectures, Father Josiah opens the Scriptures and the writings of the Church Fathers on the subject of heaven in an effort to plant a deep impression of the future life of God’s children, and to stir up a great desire for obtaining it.\n\nLecture titles are:                                                 \n\nLecture #1 Heaven in the Holy Gospels\n\nLecture #2 Heaven in the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles\n\nLecture #3 Heaven in the Apocalypse\n\nLecture #4 Heaven in the Church Fathers: A Florilegium\n\nLecture #5 Heaven: A Definitive End and a New Beginning\n\nLecture #6 What is Heaven Actually Like: Common Questions\n\nLecture #7 Heaven Mislaid: The Eclipse of Heaven in the Secular West and the Christian Response\n\n\n———SOCIAL MEDIA———\n\nPatristic Nectar Instagram: https://bit.ly/3kmupqE\nPatristic Nectar Facebook: https://bit.ly/33Bzmpx\nPatristic Nectar Twitter: https://bit.ly/3igrH4f\n\n\n———SUPPORT PATRISTIC NECTAR———\n\n1) Spread the Word - tell your family and friends about Patristic Nectar.

In the fall of 1998, he was invited to join the faculty of Harvard Divinity School, where he was Professor of Patristics and Orthodox Theology from 1998-2004. Responding to a life-long calling to the monastic life, he resigned his position at Harvard and was tonsured a great-schema monk at the Holy Monastery of Simonopetra, where he lived from 2004-2011. He was subsequently invited by Archbishop Demetrios to return to Holy Cross, where he has been an outstanding teacher, rigorous academic mentor, and prolific scholar. His publications include five books, more than fifty articles (many of them of monograph-length), and a dozen translated volumes. His current research project is a first-ever critical edition and English translation of the Life of the Virgin by the tenth-century Byzantine writer John Geometres.\n\nFr.

His research interests focus on the Patristic and Byzantine interpretation of Scripture, the Philokalia and Orthodox spirituality, the study of Byzantine manuscripts, and the theological study of Byzantine art, icons, and iconography. Fr Maximos’ interest in the arts began with a program of study at the School of Visual Arts in New York City (1979-1980), and he currently works as a consultant for American filmmaker Terrence Malick, including work on Malick’s most recent film, A Hidden Life, which is based on the real-life story of Franz Jägerstätter, an Austrian conscientious objector during World War II, who was sentenced to death and executed. He was later declared a martyr and beatified by the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nFr Maximos has twice held fellowships at Dumbarton Oaks, Harvard University’s Center for Byzantine Studies in Washington, D.C. (1992-1993, 2000-2002); he was the Inaugural James Rubin Visiting Professor of Patristic and Byzantine Studies at Hebrew University, Jerusalem (1991-1992); and a Visiting Professor of Patristics and Byzantine Literature and Consultant to the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (UCLA, Irvine, 2001). In 2003, he was invited to teach Orthodox Theology at the École Pratique des Hautes Études in Paris; and in 2016, he served as a Visiting Professor of Byzantine Literature at Harvard University’s Department of the Classics (2016).

His research interests focus on the Patristic and Byzantine interpretation of Scripture, the Philokalia and Orthodox spirituality, the study of Byzantine manuscripts, and the theological study of Byzantine art, icons, and iconography. Fr Maximos’ interest in the arts began with a program of study at the School of Visual Arts in New York City (1979-1980), and he currently works as a consultant for American filmmaker Terrence Malick, including work on Malick’s most recent film, A Hidden Life, which is based on the real-life story of Franz Jägerstätter, an Austrian conscientious objector during World War II, who was sentenced to death and executed. He was later declared a martyr and beatified by the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nFr Maximos has twice held fellowships at Dumbarton Oaks, Harvard University’s Center for Byzantine Studies in Washington, D.C. (1992-1993, 2000-2002); he was the Inaugural James Rubin Visiting Professor of Patristic and Byzantine Studies at Hebrew University, Jerusalem (1991-1992); and a Visiting Professor of Patristics and Byzantine Literature and Consultant to the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (UCLA, Irvine, 2001). In 2003, he was invited to teach Orthodox Theology at the École Pratique des Hautes Études in Paris; and in 2016, he served as a Visiting Professor of Byzantine Literature at Harvard University’s Department of the Classics (2016). He is a member of numerous international theological societies, and serves on multiple editorial boards, including Analogia: A Journal of Theological Dialogue; and Harvard University’s prestigious Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library series.\n\nFr Maximos is the author of Proclus of Constantinople and the Cult of the Virgin in Late Antiquity (2003); Maximos the Confessor, On Difficulties in the Church Fathers: The Ambigua to Thomas and John (2014); The Art of Seeing: Paradox and Perception in Orthodox Iconography (2014); Mother of the Light: Prayers to the Theotokos (2018); Maximos the Confessor, On Difficulties in Sacred Scripture: The Responses to the Questions of Thalassios (2019); St John Chrysostom and the Jesus Prayer: A Contribution to the Study of the Philokalia (2019); and The Light of the World: Prayers to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (2020). He has also translated four volumes of the writings of the Athonite Elder Aimilianos of Simonopetra: The Church at Prayer: The Mystical Liturgy of the Heart (2005); The Way of the Spirit: Reflections on Life in God (2009); Psalms and the Life of Faith (2015); and The Mystical Marriage: Spiritual Life according to St Maximos the Confessor (2018).\n\nFr. Maximos is currently Interim Dean of Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology.\n\n———SOCIAL MEDIA———\n\nPatristic Nectar Instagram: https://bit.ly/3kmupqE\nPatristic Nectar Facebook: https://bit.ly/33Bzmpx\n\n———SUPPORT PATRISTIC NECTAR———\n\nhttps://patristicnectar.org/donations",

    "description": "In this reflection, Father Josiah Trenham speaks on the Gospel of Matthew 18:23–35, warning against the “damnable gap” that forms when we receive God’s mercy but refuse to show mercy to others. Drawing on the parable of the unforgiving servant and the example of St. Dionysius of Zakynthos, Father Josiah exhorts us to let God’s grace shape our relationships and daily life.\n\n🎟️ Get tickets now for our Marriage Conference:\n👉 https://www.themarriageconference.com/\n\n📲 Access More Orthodox Content:\n\n*Patristic Nectar App*\n\nApp Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/patristic-nectar/id6502949324\n\nGoogle Play: https://play.google.com/store/search?q=patristic+nectar+app&c=apps\n\nSpotify Podcast: https://open.spotify.com/show/1VKxdB2ZCzk8evUA4V7tku?si=b679feac4ab34d63\n\n🙏 Support Our Ministry:\n\nDonate: Text PNP to 53555 (tax-deductible)\n\n*Merchandise:*  https://patristic-nectar.mybigcommerce.com\n\n#OrthodoxChristianity #ChurchFathers #ChristianFaith #SpiritualGrowth #FaithAndWorks #Theology #EasternOrthodoxy #Catechesis #ChristianTradition #GospelTruth #ChristianDoctrine #OrthodoxTeaching #DivineWisdom #ChristianLiving #FatherJosiahTrenham #PatristicNectar",

The Wisdom of Sirach or Ecclesiasticus, as the book is known in the Western or Latin tradition, is a choice composition from the Wisdom literature of the Old Testament.  Written in the 2nd century BC in Hebrew and translated into Greek by the author's grandson in Alexandria, Egypt, this majestic portion of Holy Scripture combines the rich aphorisms of traditional Hebrew sapiential literature with the concerns and background of 2nd-century Hellenic culture. Jesus, the Son of Sirach, was highly prized by the Church Fathers from the earliest days of the Church. In these five lectures, Father Josiah hones in on the themes of learning and seeking wisdom, humility, work, wealth, almsgiving, friendship, social life, wives, women, medicine and physicians, youth and aging, and wise speech and the power of words. In these topical lectures, practical substance is given to the practice of the fear of God in a wide array of human activity so that the servant of God pleases the Lord and lives thoroughly and thoughtfully before Him.  \n\nLecture #1 - Learning and Humility.\n\nLecture #2 - Work and Wealth in Sirach\n\nLecture #3 - Almsgiving, Friendship, and Social Relations\n\nLecture #4 - Wives, Women, and the Stages of Life\n\nLecture #5 - Wise Words\n\n\n———SOCIAL MEDIA———\n\nPatristic Nectar Instagram: https://bit.ly/3kmupqE\nPatristic Nectar Facebook: https://bit.ly/33Bzmpx\nPatristic Nectar Twitter: https://bit.ly/3igrH4f\n\n\n———SUPPORT PATRISTIC NECTAR———\n\n1) Spread the Word - tell your family and friends about Patristic Nectar.

One of the most shocking realities of the preaching and teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ to His early 1st century Judean audience was His fervent, expansive, and repetitive teaching on heaven. Heaven literally permeates the Sermon on the Mount and our Savior’s Parabolic instruction. The Holy Apostles received this single-eyed focus upon the next life from the Lord Christ and passed this teaching on to their disciples in the early Church. Sacred tradition has vivified and animated the discipleship of Christians in their race toward heaven ever since. In these lectures, Father Josiah opens the Scriptures and the writings of the Church Fathers on the subject of heaven in an effort to plant a deep impression of the future life of God’s children, and to stir up a great desire for obtaining it.\n\nLecture titles are:                                                 \n\nLecture #1 Heaven in the Holy Gospels\n\nLecture #2 Heaven in the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles\n\nLecture #3 Heaven in the Apocalypse\n\nLecture #4 Heaven in the Church Fathers: A Florilegium\n\nLecture #5 Heaven: A Definitive End and a New Beginning\n\nLecture #6 What is Heaven Actually Like: Common Questions\n\nLecture #7 Heaven Mislaid: The Eclipse of Heaven in the Secular West and the Christian Response\n\n\n———SOCIAL MEDIA———\n\nPatristic Nectar Instagram: https://bit.ly/3kmupqE\nPatristic Nectar Facebook: https://bit.ly/33Bzmpx\nPatristic Nectar Twitter: https://bit.ly/3igrH4f\n\n\n———SUPPORT PATRISTIC NECTAR———\n\n1) Spread the Word - tell your family and friends about Patristic Nectar.

The Scriptures are replete with teaching on the dark powers. Additionally, it is impossible to appreciate the magnitude of the saving deeds of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, without understanding how He, and He alone, has conquered Satan and destroyed his works. Lastly, Christians are called to fight and win in the spiritual war, and for this reason, it is essential that believers understand their enemies and their tactics. Toward this end, Father Josiah presents in these lectures in-depth studies of the Scriptures, Divine Services, and pedagogy of great saints and teachers on the subject of Satan and spiritual battle. \n\nLecture titles include: \n\nLecture #1 Jesus and Satan \n\nLecture #2 Demonology in the Baptismal Rite and the Divine Liturgy \n\nLecture #3 Gaining Mastery of Satan: The Life of St. Anthony the Great \n\nLecture #4 How to Win the Spiritual Battle according to St. John of the Ladder \n\nLecture #5 Engaging the Unseen Warfare: Fr. Lorenzo Scupoli and St. Nicodemos of the Holy Mountain \n\nLecture #6 C. S.

One of the most shocking realities of the preaching and teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ to His early 1st century Judean audience was His fervent, expansive, and repetitive teaching on heaven. Heaven literally permeates the Sermon on the Mount and our Savior’s Parabolic instruction. The Holy Apostles received this single-eyed focus upon the next life from the Lord Christ and passed this teaching on to their disciples in the early Church. Sacred tradition has vivified and animated the discipleship of Christians in their race toward heaven ever since. In these lectures, Father Josiah opens the Scriptures and the writings of the Church Fathers on the subject of heaven in an effort to plant a deep impression of the future life of God’s children, and to stir up a great desire for obtaining it.\n\nLecture titles are:                                                 \n\nLecture #1 Heaven in the Holy Gospels\n\nLecture #2 Heaven in the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles\n\nLecture #3 Heaven in the Apocalypse\n\nLecture #4 Heaven in the Church Fathers: A Florilegium\n\nLecture #5 Heaven: A Definitive End and a New Beginning\n\nLecture #6 What is Heaven Actually Like: Common Questions\n\nLecture #7 Heaven Mislaid: The Eclipse of Heaven in the Secular West and the Christian Response\n\n\n———SOCIAL MEDIA———\n\nPatristic Nectar Instagram: https://bit.ly/3kmupqE\nPatristic Nectar Facebook: https://bit.ly/33Bzmpx\nPatristic Nectar Twitter: https://bit.ly/3igrH4f\n\n\n———SUPPORT PATRISTIC NECTAR———\n\n1) Spread the Word - tell your family and friends about Patristic Nectar.
